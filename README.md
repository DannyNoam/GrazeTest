# PHP Test for Graze

This is a private repository documenting my progress with the PHP test given by Graze.com

By inputting an account ID on the homepage (e.g. 10700), the account's history of boxes will appear, with the option to change the ratings of any given product.

Time permitting, the following (largely aesthetic) features would have been implemented:

* Dynamic AJAX calls for changing ratings
* Pagination for boxes
* A generally nicer looking view

I'm temporarily hosting it on my dissertation domain, http://vctra.de, if you wish to try it.

Enjoy!

Danny
